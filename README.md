# RainyPlatformsV2
University 2nd Semester Game Project. SDL 2.0 and C++.

This is a University Project I have for my second semester, I chose to make a 2D platformer game, similar to Super Mario.
Right now it's super janky and barebones.

## Features

- Map Scrolling
- Exception Handling
- .map scanner
- Optimized Texture loading
- AntiGhosting

## Features to be implemented

- Basic Physics
- Collision
- Jumping

## Contributions

As this was just a project for university, I'm not really open to contributions, I will finish the features to be implemented and move on to another project.

## Project Status
 
This was a project I did early on in university, as I currently have other projects to handle, development for this is pretty much stopped completly.
