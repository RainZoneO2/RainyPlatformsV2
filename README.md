University 2nd Semester Game Project. SDL 2.0 and C++, 

This is a University Project I have for my second semester, I chose to make a 2D platformer game, similar to Super Mario

Right now it's super janky and barebones.

Things to implement:
-Gravity
-Jumping
-AntiGhosting (Keyboard States)
-Optimized Texture loading
-.map scanner
